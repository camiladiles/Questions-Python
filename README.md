# Questions-Python
 Problems solved with Python

 # Exercises realized by myself during a minicamp in Python!

 Every file has 11 exercises with the level of the complex, and every file has new knowledge I was learning during my course.

 I hope it can be Ãºtil to see a bit about my abilities to learn and solve problems in this programming language.
